# Low-Cost-Preservation-Audio-Digitisation-with-Raspberry-Pi
This page provides information on low cost solutions for audio digitisation and preservation.  

The information listed here provides the basis for a workshop presented at the 55th International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) conference, titled [Low Cost Preservation: Audio Digitisation with Raspberry Pi](https://iasavalencia24.sched.com/event/1f7qY/preservation-in-times-of-economic-crisis).

## Raspberry Pi
A series of single board computers (SBC) developed by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).  

Powered by ARM processors, the latest Raspberry Pi models (4 and 5) are available with 4GB or 8GB of RAM. They run Raspberry Pi OS, a Debian-based Linux distribution, and are now powerful enough to handle tasks such as running audio digitisation software.
