# Low-Cost-Preservation-Audio-Digitisation-with-Raspberry-Pi
This page provides information on low cost solutions for audio digitisation and preservation.  

The information listed here provides the basis for a workshop presented at the 55th International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) conference, titled [Low Cost Preservation: Audio Digitisation with Raspberry Pi](https://iasavalencia24.sched.com/event/1f7qY/preservation-in-times-of-economic-crisis).

## Raspberry Pi
A series of single board computers (SBC) developed by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).  

The Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 models run on ARM processors, with 4GB and 8GB RAM configurations.  The Pi runs Rasberry Pi OS, a Debian Linux distribution, and is powerful enough to run audio digitsation software.
